## Prerequisites

As I mentioned earlier, I recommend you have the basic understanding of modern programming. If you do not, you might find it difficult for you to follow the rest of the course.

- How to declare variables,
- How do to basic arithmetics
- How do use basic logical operators (_AND_ and _OR_)
- How to write conditional blocks
- How to use loops

You can find any online resouces that you like to learn the above knowledge, I personally recommend part 1.1 and 1.2 of [javascript.info](https://www.javascript.info/).

However, if your time is tight and you want to get your feet wet as soon as possible, the following is a quick guide on it.
